## Release v1.0.0 [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.8183230.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8183230)

This code can be used to generate simulations similar to Fig. 1 in the following paper:

V. Bordignon, M. Kayaalp, V. Matta, and A. H.  Sayed, "Social learning with non-Bayesian local updates,'' Proc. EUSIPCO, pp. 1-5, Helsinki, Finland, Sep. 2023.

The images used in Fig. 1 are generated executing file 'main.py'.

Please note that the code is not generally perfected for performance, but is rather meant to illustrate certain results from the paper. The code is provided as-is without guarantees.
